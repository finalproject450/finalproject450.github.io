      <h3>The CIA Triad</h3>
      <h5>A triple threat, Jan 7, 2023</h5>
      <img src="cia_triad.png" alt="CIA Triad" width="700" height="250">
      <br>
      <p>                                                         </p>
      
      <p>The three letters in "CIA triad" stand for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. The CIA triad is a common model that 
        forms the basis for the development of security systems. They are used for finding vulnerabilities and methods for creating solutions.

The confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information is crucial to the operation of a business, and the CIA triad 
segments these three ideas into separate focal points. This differentiation is helpful because it helps guide security teams as they pinpoint 
    the different ways in which they can address each concern. Ideally, when all three standards have been met, the security profile of
        the organization is stronger and better equipped to handle threat incidents.         
        </p>
      
      <p>Confidentiality involves the efforts of an organization to make sure data is kept secret or private. To accomplish this, access to 
        information must be controlled to prevent the unauthorized sharing of data—whether intentional or accidental. A key component of 
        maintaining confidentiality is making sure that people without proper authorization are prevented from accessing assets important 
        to your business. Conversely, an effective system also ensures that those who need to have access have the necessary privileges.</p>
      
      <p>Integrity involves making sure your data is trustworthy and free from tampering. The integrity of your data is maintained only 
        if the data is authentic, accurate, and reliable. Compromising integrity is often done intentionally. An attacker may bypass an 
        intrusion detection system (IDS), change file configurations to allow unauthorized access, or alter the logs kept by the system to
        hide the attack. Integrity may also be violated by accident. Someone may accidentally enter the wrong code or make another kind of 
        careless mistake. Also, if the company’s security policies, protections, and procedures are inadequate, integrity can be violated 
        without any one person in the organization accountable for the blame.     
        </p>
      
      <p>Even if data is kept confidential and its integrity maintained, it is often useless unless it is available to those in the 
        organization and the customers they serve. This means that systems, networks, and applications must be functioning as they should and 
        when they should. Also, individuals with access to specific information must be able to consume it when they need to, and getting to 
        the data should not take an inordinate amount of time.</p>

      <h2>Role of The Human Factor In Cybersecurity</h2>
      <h5>The Human Element, Jan 10, 2023</h5>
      <img src="security.png" alt="The Human Factor" width="700" height="250"> 
      <p>                </p>
      <br>                                                                        
      <p>Humans are human...</p> 
      <p>With rapid technological advancements, organizations around the globe continue to experience massive incidents of cyberattacks.
        Typically, these cyberattacks are associated to both <b>insider</b> as well as <b>outsider</b> attacks. 
        In this regard, outsider attacks refers to attacks originating from the internet while insider attacks refers to attacks originating from within an organization.</p>
      <p>To mitigate cyberthreats, therefore, organizations must be prepared to address both insider as well as outsider threats. While technical security controls can help to in addressing outsider threats, they might fail to properly detect and identify insider attacks. 
        This is because insider attacks are initiated by individuals entrusted and given acccess privileges to access critical business assets within an organization.</p>
    <p>They can include:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Employees</li> 
    <li>Security personnel</li> 
    <li>Managers</li>
      <li>Contractors</li>
    <li>Suppliers</li>
    </ul>
      
      <br>
      
      
      
      <h2>What Is Information Security</h2>
      <h5>Information Security Policies, Jan 23, 2023</h5>
      <img src="infosec.png" alt="Security Policies" width="700" height="250"> 
      <p>                </p>
   
<br>
        <p> The Basics of Information Security </p>
      <p>An information security policy (ISP) is a set of rules, policies and procedures designed to ensure all end users and networks within 
        an organization meet minimum IT security and data protection security requirements. ISPs should address all data, programs, systems, facilities, infrastructure, authorized users, third parties and fourth
        parties of an organization.</p>
      
      <p>An information security policy aims to enact protections and limit the distribution of data to only those with authorized access. 
        Organizations create ISPs to:</p>
      
      <ul>
            <li>Establish a general approach to information security</li>
    <li>Document security measures and user access control policies</li>
    <li>Detect and minimize the impact of compromised information assets such as misuse of data, networks, mobile devices, computers and applications</li>
    <li>Protect the reputation of the organization</li>
    <li>Comply with legal and regulatory requirements like NIST, GDPR, HIPAA and FERPA</li>
    <li>Protect their customer's data, such as credit card numbers</li>
    <li>Provide effective mechanisms to respond to complaints and queries related to real or perceived cyber security risks such as phishing, malware and ransomware</li>
   <li>Limit access to key information technology assets to those who have an acceptable use</li>
                        
        </ul>
    
         <br>
      
     
      <h2>Social Engineering Attacks</h2>
      <h5>What Is A Phishing Attack<, Jan 30, 2023</h5>
      <img src="phishing.png" alt="Security Policies" width="700" height="250"> 
      <p>                </p>
   
<br>
        <p>Phishing is a type of social engineering attack often used to steal user data, including login credentials and credit card numbers.
        It occurs when an attacker, masquerading as a trusted entity, dupes a victim into opening an email, instant message, or text message. 
        The recipient is then tricked into clicking a malicious link, which can lead to the installation of malware, the freezing of the 
        system as part of a ransomware attack or the revealing of sensitive information.
        </p>
      
      <p>An attack can have devastating results. For individuals, this includes unauthorized purchases, the stealing of funds, or identify theft.

Moreover, phishing is often used to gain a foothold in corporate or governmental networks as a part of a larger attack, such as an advanced 
        persistent threat (APT) event. In this latter scenario, employees are compromised in order to bypass security perimeters, distribute 
        malware inside a closed environment, or gain privileged access to secured data.</p>
